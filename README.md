# RatinaMaze
The "Rat in a Maze" project involves creating a program to navigate a maze represented as a 2D grid from a starting point to an exit, avoiding obstacles. This typically includes implementing a maze-solving algorithm, handling user input/output, and optionally providing a graphical interface for visualization.
